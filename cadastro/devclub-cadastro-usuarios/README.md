# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



Project for front and backend based on a react/javascript SPA, only for studies purposes

1 - started project with command 
    npm craete vite@latest 
    It was necessary to create a react project with proper folders and initial setup

    It always asks the project name and the technology used

2 - Choose: react
3 - Then select  javascript or other of your choice

4 - The <package.json> file handles dependencies and other project configurations

5 - Run 'npm install' or 'npm i' on the terminal, so the module libraries can be installed

The <index.css> file is the global css styling

6 - Using AXIOS as library that will connect front to back ends.
npm install axios
