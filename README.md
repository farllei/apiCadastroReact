# A summarizer of the API Cadastro React

This project is a full-stack application for managing person registration using a REST API. The back-end is built with Node.js and Express, utilizing Prisma as an ORM to interact with a MongoDB database. CORS is implemented to manage cross-origin resource sharing, ensuring secure and controlled communication between the client and server.

On the front-end, the application is developed using React.js and Vite.js, offering a fast and efficient development environment. Axios is used for making HTTP requests to the REST API, enabling seamless data interaction between the front-end and back-end components.

This project demonstrates a practical implementation of modern web development practices, integrating a robust back-end with a responsive front-end. It showcases the power of using a MongoDB database with Prisma for data management, and the efficiency of React.js and Vite.js for building a dynamic user interface.
